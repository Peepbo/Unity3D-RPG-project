BLEND SHAPES (Available on some models):
We achieve mesh morphing, the ability to change the physical mesh of the characters/objects, through non-animated blend shapes. The "DEMO" prefabs will have a "Blend Shape Manager" script attached, which makes it easier to manage the blend shape values. You can also find the raw values in the SkinnedMeshRenderer of each object that has blend shapes.  It is highly recommended you use the manager script provided, or write your own.

Not all objects/characters will have blend shapes. For those that do, often there will be a "Blend Shapes Preset" folder in the character folder. The "Ranges" .txt file has suggested range limitations for the shape. Check out my YouTube channel for instructions on how to use this file. (In most cases, the values will already be active on the character/object)

If there is no folder for presets, it is likely because the min/max values will work for this character.

If there is no Blend Shapes Manager component attached to the demo, it means there are no blend shapes for this character.


CURRENT BUGS / NOTES:
[Unity 2018.4 - 2019.3] Some versions of the Unity Editor seem to exaggerate the blend shape values, meaning the range presets I have provided may be too high. This is not a bug I can fix, and only affects some versions when using blend shapes for mesh morphing. If you wish to use Mesh Morphing, please check the “Randomize Everything” button in the Blend Shapes Manager inspector, and make sure that things look right for your project. For these veresions, set the Global Modifier to 0.5. This variable will modify all blend shape values, making it easier to work around the bug.
